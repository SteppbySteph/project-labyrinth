# Project Labyrinth

This project was done by Michael and Stephannie.
We learned:

- How to work with APIs together with Redux
- How to use thunks
- How to send JSON in the body of a request

## The problem

We decided to work on the functionality first and get all of the components and reducer actions and thunks in place. We used POSTMAN for solving some of the issues we had with the API call, and used some console logging of the store to setup our initial store state.

After we played through the game without any styling, we decided to go with a retro color scheme that fit the gameplay. We also found a typewriter effect on NPM that made the game feel a little more dynamic.
